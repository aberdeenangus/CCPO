# Examine the relationship of Temperature (T), Ambient Pressure (AP), Relative Humidity (RH) and Exhaust Vacuum (V) to predict the net hourly electrical energy output (PE) of the plant.

# Used Random Forest and Linear Regression to predict the dependent variable PE, then compare the performance of the two algorithms.

# Data set is available at http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/combined+cycle+power+plant
